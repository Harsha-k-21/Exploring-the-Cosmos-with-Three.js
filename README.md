 Exploring the Cosmos - Three.js Project

This project is a visually immersive 3D space scene built using Three.js. It features twinkling stars, a rotating central star-shaped figure, and interactive effects where the large star changes color upon mouse hover.

✨ Features
- "Twinkling Stars:" Small stars that slowly move forward, creating a dynamic starfield effect.
- "Rotating Big Star:" A large, central star shape that continuously rotates.
- "Interactive Hover Effect:" The big star changes colors when hovered over.
- "Smooth Camera Control:" Users can interact with the scene using OrbitControls.
